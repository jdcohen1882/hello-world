# hello-world

This is my very first entry into Git. It's part of a multi-pronged career change including learning new skills like SQL and Python. I don't even know if I'm creating this repository in Git or GitHub. That's how newb I am to this. In fact, I'm new to an entire world of software development. I'm currently studying SQL and today (1/14/2020) started a course on Python which introduced me to Anaconda Navigator, Jupyter Notebooks and Sublime Text Editor.

My initial reaction is one of shock. There is so much information and code it seems unbelievable to think that in, hopefully, a short amount of time I'll be using these new tools quickly and with familiarity.

I'm here because my goal is to change careers. I come from a world of customer service and account management jobs. I love working with people, solving problems and making people happy. However, customer service is incredibly draining. My soul can't handle customers anymore. I'm interested in a future proof career that leverages hard skills so I can rely on my brain and not on my ability to absorb customer complaints. That's a but too simple of an explanation, but that's the gist of it.

I'll come back to this Read Me in the near future to see just how far I've come.

Thanks for README'ing me. 
Jonathan
